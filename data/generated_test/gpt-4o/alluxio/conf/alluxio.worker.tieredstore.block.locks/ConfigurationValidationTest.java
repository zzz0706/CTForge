     * - As per the description, `blockLocks` determines the total number of block locks for an Alluxio block worker.
     * - A value that is too large may lead to excessive space usage, while a value that is too small may lead to coarse locking granularity.
     * - Hence, we need to ensure it is positive and within a valid range.
     * - In absence of additional constraints in the source code, assume minimum value should be 1 (since zero or negative values would not make logical sense).
